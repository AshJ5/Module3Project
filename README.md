# Module 3 Project

# Create a Full Stack Application 

## Team Responsibilities

- Initial Task Creation: The Team Lead will lead a group meeting where tasks for each role are planned.
- Task Selection: As tasks receive detailed instructions, each team member should be designated as the Assignee for the tasks their role is responsible for.
- Daily Updates: Each team member must comment daily on their task progress via the Schoology Assessments and move tasks from Backlog to In Progress, and then to Done in Trello as they are completed.

## Project Minimum Requirements

- Project Documentation: Outline the project’s name, purpose, and target audience.
- Project Diagrams: Visualize the app’s structure, including external libraries for key functions and a minimum of three app tiers (web server, application, database), plus a list of pages/features and server endpoints for deployment.
- UI Design: Mockup each app page’s design and decide on the UI construction approach (e.g. plain HTML, React, server-rendered HTML).


## Development Tasks

- Frontend Application: Break down frontend features into tasks for the repository, pages, components, and functions.
Server Design: Specify libraries, routes, parameters (with datatypes/object schema), and methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Backend Application: Detail backend features into tasks for the repository, library integration, functions, and routes.
- Database Schema Design: Determine necessary collections and fields for each object within.
- Database Creation: Use Mongoose for schema/model creation and data seeding if default data is needed for your app.

## Testing & Deployment
### Integration Tests
#### Local App Testing
- Are the backend, frontend and database all running and able to communicate?
- Is a user able to successfully access and use the application?
#### App Deployment
- Are the backend, frontend and database all running outside of your team's development machines and able to communicate?
#### Deployed App Testing
- Are users able to access and successfully utilize app features?
#### Unit Tests
- Does a particular page open?
- Does a particular feature on the page look how it should?
- Does a particular feature function as it should?
## Final Submission
- Documentation & App Links: Provide links to all documentation, designs, diagrams, project management boards, and deployment.
- App Execution: Include links for running the app (and instructions for starting/running the application if applicable).
